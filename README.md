## Installation

First of all, install the latest stable version of ROS.
Please refer to [ROS WiKi](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation) for installation.

Next, download the dependent ROS package and this repository.

```
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-urg-node
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-slam-gmapping
git clone https://github.com/zaki0929/slam_gmapping.git
cp -r slam_gmapping/gmapping ~/catkin_ws/src/.
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/zaki0929/raspimouse_gmapping.git
git clone https://github.com/zaki0929/raspimouse_transportation.git
git clone https://github.com/zaki0929/raspimouse_navigation_2.git
git clone https://github.com/zaki0929/navigation.git
git clone https://github.com/AtsushiSaito/lab_usb_9axisimu_driver.git
```

Finally, build the downloaded ones.

```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```````
## Usage

### Step 1

In order to use this package, you need to launch the launch file on Raspberry Pi Mouse side and PC side as follows.

#### PC side

```
roslaunch raspimouse_gmapping remote_desktop.launch
roslaunch raspimouse_map_splitter generate_bag_file_and_shell_script.launch
```

#### Raspberry Pi Mouse side

```
roslaunch raspimouse_navigation_2 remote_robot.launch
```

If you want to run the robot automatically to create a map, please execute the following command.

Then the robot run along the left wall using sensor values from LIDAR.

```
rosrun raspimouse_transportation grid_base
```

### Step 2

Please kidnap the robot while generating the map and check that the following Info will be output.

```
ROS [ INFO] [ROS Time]: Shell script generated.
```
After checking the above info, please continue to generate the map as it is.

Please terminate the process executed above when the map generation is completed.

Next, please execute the generated shell script.

```
source ~/.ros/split.sh
```

### Step 3

In step 2, two bagfiles named target_before.bag and target_after.bag should be generated.

By playing these bagfiles as follows you can get a map before kidnapping and a map after kidnapping.

#### Generate a map before kidnapping

```
roslaunch raspimouse_gmapping remote_desktop.launch
rosbag play ~/.ros/target_before.bag
```

#### Generate a map after kidnapping

```
roslaunch raspimouse_gmapping remote_desktop.launch
rosbag play ~/.ros/target_after.bag
```
